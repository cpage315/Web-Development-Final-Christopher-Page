# Web Development Final Christopher Page

## PLEASE READ FIRST

I am most certainly not finished with this project. In fact far from it.
This is mostly due to me struggling with the project every step of the way, and not being the most encapsulated by web development as a whole
However, I would like to see it through over the summer if I can.

There are some issues with the profile page. The main issue is that sometimes it does not show your profile information.
I have not been able to troubleshoot it yet. If anything, I've made the issues worse from trying solutions outside of my knowledge.

I am not entirely pleased with the front end of the assignment. When I continue on this project I am going to try and revamp the front end entirely.
Stay tuned for that!


## Project's Purpose:

The project is made to be a website for baseball instructor's clients.
As an instructor/coach myself, I figrued that an idea like this would help organizing information on both client and instructor side.
User's on this application can register/make a profile and schedule appointments.
In the future, I would like to add tabs for instructors to see their clients and potentially tabs for clients to input video of game footage.
This app is not finished.


## Bugs:

So the biggest issue that I have newly run into as stated earlier is that the profile page is not working correctly right now.
Sometimes it displays the information and sometimes it does not.
I am not sure of how to fix the issue.
I tried to fix it with some online resources along with some inspiration from other applications, but no solution yet.


## How its Made:

The front end of this assignment was built using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS
The back end of was built using MySQL, Node, and Axios (I think?)
